## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

All the libraries required for running the app are listed in the requirement.txt file.
For installing these libraries, only run this command with Python 3 in root path:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Instruction <a name="instruction"></a>

Execute all cells of starbucks_offers.ipynb


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is the final project for the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree program. For this project I am interestested in building a machine learning model to predict offer success. 

I develop all those steps: 

- I: Business Understanding
- II: Dependencies
- III: Data Understanding
- IV: Data Wrangling
- V: Exploratory Analysis
- VI: Build a ML model to predict offer success
- VII: Conclusion
